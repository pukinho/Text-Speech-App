# Text-Speech-App
Simple JS app that translates text to live speech, created using HTML, Bootstrap and JS

App created based on Speech Synthesis API

This app works best on Google Chrome, since other browsers do not output all the available voices.

You can also change the rate and pitch of the robo-voice.
